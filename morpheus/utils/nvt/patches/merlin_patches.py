def patch_numpy_dtype_registry():

    Patches the Merlin dtypes registry to support conversion from Merlin 'struct' dtypes to the equivalent numpy object.
    This is necessary to support pandas conversion of input dataframes containing 'struct' dtypes within an NVT
    operator.

    Until this is fixed upstream, with the mappings added to `merlin/dtypes/mappings/numpy.py`, this patch should be
    used. The function is idempotent, and should be called before any NVT operators are used.
